OpenGL Fractals
===============

This is a collection of C++ fractal generating programs using OpenGL with GLFW for display.

None of the code is optimized yet, but most of it will run acceptably fast with the number of iterations visible.

The Dragon and Hilbert Curves and the Koch Snowflake are generated by following the path along the curve, modifying the curve as the depth of the fractal increases.

The Sierpinski Triangle is generated via the "Chaos Game" method.

The Menger Sponge is generated by drawing the "holes." "Holes" that are inside other holes are also drawn, this allows the grid to be generated without making decisions.

The Logistic Bifurcation is generated by running the calculation and plotting the last 5% of the values.
